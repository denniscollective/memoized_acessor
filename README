I frequently find myself writing something along the lines of

class Person
	attr_writer :best_friend
	def best_friend
		@best_friend ||= do_expensive_stuff_to_figure_out_who_the_lucky_person_is
	end
end

well now you can save a million keystrokes and a thousand lines of code by doing

class Person
	memoized_accessor(:best_friend) {do_expensive_stuff_to_figure_out_who_the_lucky_person_is}
end

It might be evil metaprogramming, but hey, "You can do it in RUBY!".
